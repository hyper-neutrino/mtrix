@              <link>@             swap arguments
                                   for monads, convert to a dyad and use the right argument
                                   for nilads, convert to a dyad and ignore the arguments
`              <link>`             selfie; repeat argument
                                   for dyads, convert to a monad and use the argument on both sides
                                   for monads, convert to a dyad and use the left argument
                                   for nilads, convert to a monad and ignore the argument
Ͼ              <link>Ͼ             map over the left argument; nilads become monads
Ͽ              <link>Ͽ             map over the right argument; monads become dyads and use the right argument only (equivalent to <link>Ͼ@)
